# BitTorrent Mainline DHT [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/hlandau/dht?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/hlandau/dht)

This is a BitTorrent Mainline DHT library. It is based on, and would not have
been possible without, nictuku/dht. A major refactoring. Intended for
experimental and learning purposes.

Currently implements BEP 5 (Base DHT specification) and BEP 32 (IPv6 support).
